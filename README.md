# StormyItems

Adds a few items that build on vanilla ideas. I want to make items that make certain builds and playstyles more viable. Please let me know if there are any bugs or crashes.

IMPORTANT: Seriously, let me know if the mod no longer works. I dip in and out of Risk of Rain 2, but I will update my mod if I know it is broken. DM me on Discord @quickstraw#6646 or make an issue on my GitHub linked on this page.

- Cracked Halo: Increases movement speed when in the air.

- Sharp Anchor: Increases damage of all nearby allies after standing still for 1 second.

## Currently Working On:

- Improve stability and balance.
